Decorator
=========

* Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically and transparently (run-time)
* An alternative to sub classing (compile-time)
* Remove responsibilities no longer needed

A typical example of the decorator pattern can be found in java.io: FilterOutputStream, FilterInputStream, FilterReader,
and FilterWriter.
