 * @class TestInterrupted

 * Java thread that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD).
 * If there are no command-line arguments then sleep for 4
 * seconds while the thread computes the GCD in the background
 * and then send it an interrupt request to cause the thread to
 * exit.  If it's launched with any command-line arguments the
 * thread computing the GCD can continue to run even after the
 * main thread exits.
