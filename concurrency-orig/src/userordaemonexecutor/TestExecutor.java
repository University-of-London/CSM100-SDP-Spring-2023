/**
 * @class TestExecutor
 * @brief This program demonstrates the difference between a Java user
 * thread and a daemon thread in the context of thread pools
 * created by the Java Executor framework.  If it's launched
 * with no command-line parameters the main thread creates a
 * user thread, which can outlive the main thread (i.e., it
 * continues to run even after the main thread exits).  If it's
 * launched with a command-line parameter then it creates a
 * daemon thread, which exits when the main thread exits.

     * sleeps for 1 second while threads in the pool run.  If "daemon"
     * threads are created they will only run as long as the main
     * thread runs.  Conversely, if "user" threads are created they
     * will continue to run even after the main thread exits.
