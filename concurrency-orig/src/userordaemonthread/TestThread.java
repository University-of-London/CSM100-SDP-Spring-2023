 * @class TestThread
 * @brief This program demonstrates the difference between a Java user
 * thread and a daemon thread.  If it's launched with no
 * command-line parameters the main thread creates a user
 * thread, which can outlive the main thread (i.e., it
 * continues to run even after the main thread exits).  If it's
 * launched with a command-line parameter then it creates a
 * daemon thread, which exits when the main thread exits.

     * or "daemon") and sleeps for 1 second while that thread runs in
     * the background.  If a "daemon" thread is created it will only
     * run as long as the main thread runs.  Conversely, if a "user"
     * thread is created it will continue to run even after the main
     * thread exits.
