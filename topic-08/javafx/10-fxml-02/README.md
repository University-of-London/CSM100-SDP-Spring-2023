In this example, the `FXML` file (`person.fxml`) contains a `Label` whose text is bound to the `person.name` property. In the `Java` code, the `FXMLLoader` is used to load the `FXML` file, and the controller instance is obtained. The `setPerson()` method is called on the controller to pass a `Person` object with a name. The `Person` class has a getter for the name property. When the `FXML` file is displayed, the label's text will be set to the name of the person object passed to the controller.
