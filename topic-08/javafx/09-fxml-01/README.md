In this example, the `FXML` file (`sample.fxml`) defines a simple `VBox` layout containing a `Button`. The `fx:controller` attribute is set to the fully qualified name of the controller class (`javafx.SampleController`). In the `Java` code, the `FXMLLoader` is used to load the `FXML` file, and the root element is set as the content of the `Scene`. The controller class (`javafx.SampleController`) handles the button click event with a method named "`handleButtonClick()`".
