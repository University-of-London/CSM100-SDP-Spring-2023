Here are ten examples of Java code that demonstrate the use of graphical components and events:

- Example 1: Creating a basic window with a button
- Example 2: Adding an action listener to a button
- Example 3: Creating a label and handling mouse events
- Example 4: Creating a text field and handling key events
- Example 5: Creating a checkbox and handling item events
- Example 6: Creating a combo box and handling selection events
- Example 7: Creating a radio button and handling item events
- Example 8: Creating a slider and handling change events
- Example 9: Creating a progress bar and updating its value
- Example 10: Creating a file chooser and handling file selection

We use the SWING library (and therefore the AWT library) as it is still the most common Java GUI framework even though it is no longer supported.

These examples cover a range of graphical components, such as buttons, labels, text fields, checkboxes, combo boxes, radio buttons, sliders, progress bars, and file choosers. They also demonstrate different types of event listeners, including action listeners, mouse listeners, key listeners, item listeners, change listeners, and file choosers.
