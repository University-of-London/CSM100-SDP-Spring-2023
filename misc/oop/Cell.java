    // Parameterized types are invaiant ...
    Cell<String> c1 = new Cell<String>("abc");

    // So even though String is a subclass of Object,
    // Cell<String> is not a subclass of Cell<Object>,
    // so this line won't compile:
    //Cell<Object> c2 = c1;

    // If the above were allowed, you could have this unsafe code:
    // c2.set(1);
    // String s = c1.get();
    // Compile-time checking prevents potential run-time errors like this.


    // Invariance of generic types is necessary because of type erasure --
    // type arguments are not reified, that is, not stored at runtime (and
    // therefore can't be checked at runtime). But as the example above
    // shows, this is a good thing. Unfortunately, Java Arrays, whose
    // element types *are* reified, are covariant.
    // So this compiles:
    String[] a1 = {"abc"};
    Object[] a2 = a1;

    // But this line produces a run-time ArrayStoreException when Integer
    // is found to be incompatible with the element type String:
    a2[0] = 42;
    String s = a1[0];

    // So why are Java arrays covariant? So that earlier, pre-generics
    // versions of Java could have "generic" methods like this:
    // void sort(Object[] a, Comparator cmp);

    // Covariant arrays are no longer necessary with generics, but arrays
    // are still covariant to maintain backward compatibility.
